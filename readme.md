# Huffman Compression and Decompression

This project implements **Huffman encoding and decoding algorithms** unrelated to the file type to handle. It can handle **any file type**, transforming files into a compressed binary format and restoring them to their original state.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

#### Prerequisites
- GCC
- Make

#### Installation
1. Clone the repo
```
git clone https://github.com/tomfln07/my_huffman.git my_huffman
cd my_huffman
```

2. Compile the project
```
make
```

#### Usage
Once the project is compiled, you can use the tool to compress and decompress files.
```
bin/my_huffman (-d) [file path]
```
- file path: path to the file you want to compress / decompress
- -d: should be put before the file path to decompress it

*The compressd / decompressed file will be in your current directory*
